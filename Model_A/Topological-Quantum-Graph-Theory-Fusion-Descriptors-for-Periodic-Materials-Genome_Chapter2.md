# Chapter 2: Methodology: Multi-Scale Simplicial Complex Descriptor Framework

This chapter systematically elaborates on the construction methods of our proposed multi-scale simplicial complex descriptor framework. This framework aims to comprehensively characterize the "genome" of periodic materials from multiple levels and dimensions, thereby providing rigorous, interpretable, and physically authentic features for rational material design and performance prediction. Our methodology adheres to simplicial complex theory, abstracting periodic materials as complexes composed of simplices of different dimensions, and developing a series of innovative descriptors for each dimension, ultimately forming a fixed-dimensional global feature vector through statistical aggregation.

Specifically, this framework includes the following four core levels of descriptors, which collectively constitute a comprehensive characterization of periodic materials from microscopic to macroscopic, and from local to global:

1.  **0-Simplex Descriptors (Chapter 3)**: Focus on the atom-centered environment, aiming to capture the intrinsic physicochemical properties, electronic structure characteristics, and classical geometric and abstract algebraic properties of individual atoms and their local coordination environments. These descriptors encompass rich quantum chemical attributes such as Bader charge, electrostatic potential, electron density, and electron localization function (ELF). As these quantum features are obtained from first-principles calculations in the form of 3D grid data, we employ high-precision trilinear interpolation to accurately estimate local values at atomic nuclear sites from continuous physical field distributions, thereby bridging the gap between grid-based calculations and atom-centered property descriptions. This chapter will detail key features including `vectorial_asymmetry_norm_sq` (quantifying geometric asymmetry of the local environment) and `symmetry_breaking_quotient` (evaluating the degree of symmetry breaking from a group theory perspective).

2.  **1-Simplex Descriptors (Chapter 4)**: Focus on chemical bonds, aiming to characterize the interactions between atoms during bonding, information transfer, and the complex topological features of the bonding environment. This chapter will highlight innovative descriptors such as `lie_algebr-incompatibility` (quantifying geometric incompatibility of structural tensors at both ends of a bond), `quotient_algebra_orbit_size` (measuring the topological equivalence of bonds from a quotient algebra perspective), and `pseudo_symplectic_coupling` (revealing the strength of structural-electronic coupling in bonds).

3.  **2-Simplex Descriptors (Chapter 5)**: Focus on three-body interactions, aiming to capture more complex and refined geometric, electronic, and topological information beyond two-body interactions. This chapter will introduce advanced features such as `hierarchical_stress_flow` (describing how stress is transmitted and dissipated in three-body systems) and `point_group_reduction_factor` (measuring the symmetry and harmony of three-body systems), which are crucial for understanding bond angle distortions and lattice stability.

4.  **Global Descriptors (Chapter 6)**: As a higher-order summary, aggregation, and abstraction of the local descriptors from the preceding three chapters, these aim to quantify the overall macroscopic properties of periodic materials. This chapter will demonstrate how, by statistically aggregating the distributions of all local features and combining them with `global_asymmetry_norm`, `log_pseudo_symplectic_fluctuation_volume`, and a series of innovative graph theory path analysis features, advanced and comprehensive inputs are provided for AI-driven material design and performance prediction.

Each level of descriptors is meticulously designed, integrating interdisciplinary theories from mathematics, physics, chemistry, and computer science, and implemented through rigorous computational logic, ensuring their numerical precision, physical reliability, and academic universality. In the following chapters, we will provide detailed mathematical definitions, physicochemical meanings, and multi-disciplinary implications for each level of descriptors.
