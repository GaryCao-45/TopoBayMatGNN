# Abstract

Traditional material descriptors exhibit significant limitations in precisely quantifying prevalent complex physicochemical phenomena in periodic materials, such as structural distortions, continuous symmetry breaking, and many-body interactions. This hinders their ability to effectively decode deep-seated structure-property relationships, thereby constraining the rational design and high-throughput discovery of materials. To overcome this bottleneck, this study proposes and constructs a multi-scale topological-quantum-graph-theory fusion descriptor framework. This framework deeply integrates algebraic topology's simplicial complex theory, first-principles calculations, and graph theory path analysis. By systematically characterizing materials from the 0-simplex (atoms), 1-simplex (chemical bonds), and 2-simplex (three-body interactions) levels, up to the global scale, and through statistical aggregation, it generates a fixed-length, information-complete, and highly interpretable feature vector (material fingerprint), achieving a comprehensive digital representation of the periodic material genome.

The core innovation of this framework manifests on three levels. Firstly, in the quantification of microscopic mechanisms, this study for the first time applies Lie algebra theory to the structural characterization of periodic materials. Features such as `lie_algebr-incompatibility` enable precise quantification of symmetry breaking and local stresses caused by structural distortions. Concurrently, by introducing symplectic geometry concepts, descriptors like `log_pseudo_symplectic_fluctuation_volume` are defined to quantify the intrinsic coupling strength between structural and electronic degrees of freedom within the lattice. Secondly, in the construction of a multi-scale differentiable descriptor system, a bottom-up hierarchical feature engineering approach is established, realizing a continuously differentiable representation from atoms to many-body interactions. This system encompasses 0-simplex (atom-centered environment), 1-simplex (chemical bond), and 2-simplex (three-body interaction) descriptors, along with global descriptors reflecting overall material properties. By statistically aggregating numerous local features (e.g., `bader_charge`, `bond_distance`) through measures such as mean, variance, and extreme values, a fixed-dimensional, information-complete global feature vector is ultimately formed, ensuring data integrity, hierarchical correlation, and high compatibility with gradient optimization algorithms. Lastly, to characterize non-local correlations, this paper proposes a unified importance sampling algorithm based on multi-physical field information, used to identify key paths in the crystal topological graph. Along these paths, a series of non-local correlation functions (e.g., `path_curvature_mean`) are defined and calculated, providing a quantitative means to understand long-range order and collective dynamic behaviors.

The effectiveness of this framework has been rigorously validated through a case study on $\text{CsPbX}_3$ ($\text{X = Br, I, Cl}$) perovskite crystal systems. Notably, for $\text{CsPbCl}_3$, initially labeled as a cubic Pm-3m phase, the descriptors from this framework yielded significant non-zero asymmetry feature values, inconsistent with expectations. This anomalous result prompted a re-examination of the input structure, ultimately revealing its true structure to be orthorhombic Amm2. This discovery powerfully demonstrates that the framework not only accurately quantifies known structures but also serves as a highly sensitive structural detector, identifying potential inconsistencies or erroneous labels in input data, thereby showcasing its unique value as a tool for data validation and scientific discovery.

In summary, the core contribution of this study lies in establishing a highly interpretable, physically insightful, and universally applicable descriptor framework for AI-driven materials discovery. These descriptors not only significantly accelerate high-throughput virtual screening processes, enabling rapid prediction of material properties, but more critically, they provide an information-rich and efficient knowledge-driven search space for AI-driven inverse design, promising to transform materials science research from traditional trial-and-error exploration to a mode of precise design and intelligent discovery.
